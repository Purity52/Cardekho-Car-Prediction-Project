#### Cardekho Car Prediction Project
#### Project Overview
- This project uses the CarDekho dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting used car prices. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and model training, providing insights into the factors that influence car prices.

#### Dataset Information
- File: cardekho.csv
- The dataset contains details of used cars, including:
- Car_Name - Name of the car
- Year - Year of manufacture
- Selling_Price - Price at which the car is sold (target variable)
- Present_Price - Current ex-showroom price
- Driven_kms - Kilometers driven
- Fuel_Type - Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- Seller_Type - Dealer or Individual
- Transmission - Manual or Automatic
- Owner - Number of previous owners

#### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy - Data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn -Visualizations
- Scikit-learn - Machine learning models and evaluation

#### Objectives
- Understand which factors impact used car prices.
- Visualize key insights from the dataset.
- Build a machine learning model to predict car selling prices.
- Evaluate model performance and provide conclusions.
